<div class="info">One way of targeting multiple elements with css is by defining a CSS class</div>

<p class="info">CSS Works by selecting html elements and applying a rule</p>

<div class="info">A CSS rule consists of a declaration where a property and a value for that property are defined </div>
<p class="info">For example this element, a p element, can be targeted by a css rule that selects it, and applies a color property with a red value to it wherever p elements occur</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        When a CSS rule is applied, all things being equal the last CSS rule before the element it is selecting is the one that applies
    </li>
    <li>
        This entails that the order of CSS rules when read by a browser is:
        <ol>
            <li>inline elements get applied first</li>
            <li>then css rules that are defined internally in the html</li>
            <li>finally css rules that are linked to an external file in the reverse order that they are listed</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        For inline styling, a priority of 1000 is added to specificity
    </li>
    <li>
        For an id selector, a priority of 100 is added
    </li>
    <li>	
        For a class a priority of 10 is added
    </li>
    <li>
        For an element selector a priority of 1 is added
    </li>
</ul>
